## About this project

### Built with

- HTML5
- SASS

### What I learned

- Unordered lists also work as containers and I can use them instead of a unending stack of div.
- CSS preprocessors and Sass, using variables for colors, the nesting feature.
- Using //, to create single-line comments, which fits well my current commenting style.
- MDN is superior to GPT-3 as a practical guide for properties and elements (see final notes).

### Useful resources

- [Chat Gpt](https://chat.openai.com/) - I've been using it as a tutor of sorts. Ff properly prompted, it can be very helpful with the learning process.

- [MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/) - Awesome visual exemplifications.

## Final Notes

During this project I found Sass and I was amazed, especially by the nesting feature, being able to organize the CSS in a similar way to HTML made reading, understanding and maintaining the code so much simpler and cleaner. On the matter of GPT vs MDN, while GPT has been useful for simpler concepts and really helpful as a tutor, MDN's visual representations are far more intuitive for complex concepts. Learning how to harness the best of both resources really seems like the better path.
This is my third project and it took me way longer than anticipated since I had less available time to study in the last few days and on top of that was experimenting with Sass. Overall, I liked that the mobile version differs quite a bit from the previous challenge, but my favorite aspect was being able to use my own previous code as reference.
